# Pitch
## Inspiration Statement:
MTG Players are a community who need a way to manage their boardstate because they need to be able to keep track of a wide plethora of things, reduce their spending, and keep up with news/information about the game.

From this statement, I came up with the following ideas:

## Project Ideas:
- Boardstate tracker
    - Token management
    - Life total tracker
    - Commander damage/poison counters tracker
    - +1/+1 counter tracker for creature tokens
    - Saving token-sets for specific decklists
    - Multiple player states
- MTG thesaurus
    - Looks for alternative cards based on oracle text (2)
    - Compare prices (2/8)
    - Crowd-sourced rating system for unpopular cards/Commenting (2/8)
- Pack opening simulator
    - Allows for practice for draft/sealed events (1/4)
    - Potentially with future sets once spoilers are out (4)
    - Gambling (1)
    - Saving collection to a profile (5)
    - View other profiles (6)

## Final Idea:
I decided to go with the boardstate manager because I thought it would be the most useful for the people I play MTG with.  I think it will be both doable in a reasonable amount of time and also interesting and challanging.  Additionally, I think it's a helpful extension of common life-tracker applications.
